* Documentation pages are organised in the navigation by category, with URLs based on the path inside the `_docs` folder.

### Change log

* Add, update or remove change log entries from your posts.
* Tag entries as minor or major in the front matter.

### Search

* Add `excluded_in_search: true` to any documentation page's front matter to exclude that page in the search results.

### Navigation
